# Subumbra — Universal Zero-Trust Secret Broker

## Project Purpose
A docker-compose-based zero-trust key-broker core for applications that need to
use API keys without storing those keys in plaintext on the app server. Keys
are split across two systems — neither side can decrypt alone.

Subumbra's current reference integration surface is `subumbra-proxy`. LiteLLM
is a proven app-owned example, not the bundled product boundary. Legacy
callback-era artifacts remain in the repo for reference only.

## Architecture

```
App-owned integration (LiteLLM, LibreChat, n8n, etc.)
    ↓ api_base: http://subumbra-proxy:8090/t/<key_id>/...  (adapter token as api_key)
subumbra-proxy
    ↓ fetches encrypted record metadata and packages canonical POST /proxy
subumbra-keys (docker internal network only)
    ↓ returns V3 envelope: ciphertext + wrapped_dek + pub_key_fp + policy_hash + vault_instance
    ↓ (useless without the matching RSA private key in the selected SubumbraVault DO)
Cloudflare Worker + Durable Object
    ↓ verifies fingerprint, unwraps DEK, decrypts provider key, injects auth
API Provider
    ↓ streams response
    ↓ back through Worker → proxy → app
```

## Security Properties
- Real API keys never exist in plaintext on any system you operate
- Decrypted keys exist briefly in CF Durable Object memory (~100ms) and transit to API providers over HTTPS
- Asymmetric hybrid envelope encryption (V3): RSA-4096 wraps per-record AES-256-GCM DEKs
- subumbra-keys container: holds wrapped DEK + AES-GCM ciphertext only (useless without RSA private key)
- SubumbraVault DO: holds RSA-4096 private key in SQLite custody (never extractable after import)
- Neither side can reconstruct keys alone
- Shared-vault keys use vault instance `vault`; opt-in isolated keys use `vault-<key_id>`
- AAD binding (`subumbra:v3:<key_id>:<policy_hash>`) prevents ciphertext transplant and policy replay
- pub_key_fp verified by Worker before decryption — mismatched keys fail fast
- Decrypted key exists only in CF Durable Object memory for ~100ms
- One-shot bootstrap process: keys exist in RAM only during generation
- Offline per-key rotation: uses public key on disk, no CF interaction needed

## R45 Threat Model

These threats motivate the R45 policy schema. Each is addressed structurally
by the five-round core arc; none requires a configuration workaround.

| Threat | Description | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Skeleton key misuse** | A compromised adapter token can request any `key_id` the attacker knows, across any provider. | Policy `allow.adapters` binds each token to specific records; `capability_class` narrows the semantic scope of what can be called. Implemented in R45-4. |
| **Prompt-injection capability abuse** | An LLM-mediated app can be manipulated into making requests that exceed its intended scope (e.g. a chat app making payment API calls). | `capability_class` + `allow.methods`/`path_prefixes` prevent cross-capability use at the Worker boundary. R48 adds optional `intent.trust` initiator and content-source gating. |
| **Worker replacement via stolen deploy authority** | An attacker who obtains a Cloudflare deploy token can replace the Worker with one that does not enforce policy, exfiltrates keys, or strips auth. | Bootstrap captures the deployed Worker bundle SHA-256 to `system-integrity.json`; `subumbra-verify-deploy` detects drift. Implemented in R45-2. |
| **Response-side exfiltration** | The Worker (or a replaced Worker) could inspect or redirect upstream API responses before returning them to the adapter. | `response.deny_patterns` remains reserved in the schema; response-side scanning is deferred beyond R48 and is not yet active at runtime. |
| **Cross-adapter replay** | A ciphertext obtained by one adapter could be replayed through a different adapter or against a different provider's endpoint. | V2 AAD `subumbra:v2:<key_id>` already prevents ciphertext transplant. V3 AAD `subumbra:v3:<key_id>:<policy_hash>` additionally binds to the policy in effect at encryption time, preventing replay after policy change. Implemented in R45-3. |
| **V2→V3 drift** | V2 records have no policy binding. Mixing V2 and V3 records in a V3-enforcing Worker could allow policy bypass via a V2 record. | Grace window (V2 accepted through R45-4); hard-reject with structured deprecation error in R45-5. No silent downgrade. |
| **UI as second plaintext authority** | A UI with write access to key material or token configuration becomes a second path that bypasses the broker architecture. | UI remains read-only until a hardened management API exists. Secure UI input is deferred behind the full five-round core arc and the management API (council/rTBD-structure-upgrade/kickoff.md). |

## Key Design Decisions

### Docker Networking
- `internal` network: subumbra-keys, bootstrap, ui, subumbra-probe, subumbra-proxy — NO internet access
- `external` network: cloudflared, subumbra-proxy, subumbra-probe — internet access
- subumbra-keys is reachable from services on the internal network via Docker DNS (`http://subumbra-keys:9090`)
- subumbra-keys never exposed to host or internet

### App-Owned Integration Contract
- The current transparent entry point is `http://subumbra-proxy:8090/t`
- Apps send an adapter token as the credential and carry the requested `key_id`
  in the path after `/t/`
- `subumbra-proxy` fetches the encrypted record, packages canonical `POST /proxy`, and owns the Worker-facing request boundary
- The app never sees the decrypted provider key
- Provider-specific path suffixes in app examples are upstream API path requirements; `/t` is the Subumbra transparent route root

### Legacy Callback Reference
- `litellm/custom_callbacks.py` remains in the repo as a callback-era reference implementation
- It is not the current primary integration contract
- Standalone LiteLLM and similar external apps should follow the transparent sidecar path instead

### Bootstrap Process (one-shot)
1. Run bootstrap through the host wrapper:
   `./bootstrap.sh`
   For CI/automation: create `.env.bootstrap` first, then run the same wrapper.
   App-owned imports use `IMPORT_PATH_<n>` plus required `IMPORT_APP_LABEL_<n>`.
2. Bootstrap container:
   - Reads keys from env (RAM only)
   - Loads built-in provider `target_host` mappings and derives built-in `KNOWN_PROVIDERS` from root `providers.json`
   - Creates or reuses the provider-registry KV namespace and persists its namespace ID in `/app/data/kv-config.json`
   - Injects the `[[kv_namespaces]]` binding into the temporary deploy copy of `wrangler.toml`
   - Deploys CF Worker via wrangler
   - Pushes `SUBUMBRA_ADAPTER_TOKENS`, `SUBUMBRA_HMAC_KEY`, and a transient `SUBUMBRA_SETUP_TOKEN`
   - Uses a staged checkpoint pipeline: infra once, then per-key vault provisioning, then per-key encryption, then atomic record write
   - Calls one-shot `POST /setup/keygen` against `vault` or `vault-<key_id>` so Cloudflare generates and stores the RSA-4096 key pair in the targeted vault DO
   - Receives `public_key.pem` / `public_key_<key_id>.pem` plus `pub_key_fp` from Cloudflare
   - For each key: generates random 32-byte DEK, wraps DEK with the returned RSA public key, encrypts API key with AES-256-GCM using AAD `subumbra:v3:<key_id>:<policy_hash>`
   - Writes V3 records (ciphertext + wrapped_dek + pub_key_fp + enc_version + policy_hash + vault_instance) to subumbra-keys volume
   - Writes `public_key.pem` for shared vault and `public_key_<key_id>.pem` for unique vaults
   - Publishes the initial `subumbra_registry_v1` entry to Cloudflare KV
   - Supports targeted repair via `./bootstrap.sh --provision <key_id>` when a key-specific provisioning step fails
   - Deletes transient `SUBUMBRA_SETUP_TOKEN` and legacy `MASTER_DECRYPTION_KEY` / `WORKER_PRIVATE_KEY` / `WORKER_KEY_FINGERPRINT` secrets after successful completion
   - Exits
3. `bootstrap.sh` writes runtime env values directly into repo-local `.env` and shreds `.env.bootstrap` after success
4. Real keys existed only in RAM, never written to disk

### Per-Key Rotation (offline)
- Run: `docker compose --profile bootstrap run --rm bootstrap --rotate`
- Uses `public_key.pem` for shared keys or `public_key_<key_id>.pem` for unique keys — no CF interaction needed
- Generates new DEK, re-wraps with existing public key, re-encrypts single key
- Atomically updates only the target record in `keys.json`

### Cloudflare Worker
- Receives: canonical `/proxy` JSON-body requests from LiteLLM and future adapters
- Reads provider security metadata from the live Cloudflare KV provider registry
- Validates `target_url` hostname against the live registry entry (fail-closed)
- Validates `provider` matches the resolved registry entry
- Routes `/setup/keygen` and `/internal/rotate` to a named SQLite-backed `SubumbraVault` DO instance selected by `vault_instance`
- Verifies: pub_key_fp matches the stored vault custody row
- Unwraps: per-record DEK via RSA-OAEP using the non-extractable private key cached in the selected vault DO
- Decrypts: AES-256-GCM with AAD `subumbra:v3:<key_id>:<policy_hash>`
- Hard-rejects: non-V3 records, fingerprint mismatches
- Resolves auth policy from the registry and passes generic auth config into the vault DO
- Uses: one named shared vault DO plus optional per-key vault DO instances
- DO calls: API provider directly with decrypted key
- Durable Object no longer branches on provider identity to choose auth headers
- Worker accepts canonical `/proxy` requests only
- Returns: streaming response back to the adapter
- Strips: all X-Subumbra-* headers before upstream calls

### Adapter Contract

The canonical Subumbra core API is `POST /proxy` — see
[`docs/adapter-contract.md`](docs/adapter-contract.md)
for the full normative contract.

The current primary integration contract is the explicit transparent sidecar
(`subumbra-proxy`) using the `/t` route. Callback-era LiteLLM artifacts remain
as legacy reference only and are not the current adapter hierarchy.

### subumbra-keys Service
- Minimal Flask API
- Binds to Docker internal network only
- Validates: X-Subumbra-Token header
- Returns: V3 record metadata including `provider`, `target_host`, `ciphertext`, `wrapped_dek`, `pub_key_fp`, `enc_version`, `policy_hash`, and `vault_instance`
- Logs: every access attempt with timestamp

## Supported Providers
- anthropic (Claude models)
- openai (GPT models)
- groq (Llama, Mixtral)
- deepseek (DeepSeek models)
- cerebras
- gemini
- mistral
- openrouter
- together
- xai
- github
- slack
- sendgrid
- Additional providers can be added via the live registry workflow (`--push-registry`) without making `worker/src/providers.json` the Worker's runtime authority.

## Environment Variables

### Bootstrap (.env.bootstrap — DELETE AFTER USE)
```

```

Optional:
```

```

## UI Dashboard Features (POC)
- List of key IDs loaded (names only, never values)
- Last request time per key
- Request count per key  
- Health status of subumbra-keys container
- Recent request log (provider, timestamp, status)

## Build Order
1. docker-compose.yml skeleton
2. subumbra-keys/app.py (simplest component)
3. bootstrap/subumbra-bootstrap.py (key generation + wrangler)
4. worker/src/worker.js (CF Worker with Durable Object)
5. subumbra-proxy/app.py (transparent sidecar)
6. ui/app.py (dashboard)
7. standalone app examples and docs
8. Test end-to-end

### Error / Logging Check
For any new or changed flow, briefly state:
1. What new failure modes this round introduces
2. Which of those need an operator-visible signal
3. What should remain terse or silent to external callers
4. What must never be logged
5. What observability work is explicitly deferred

## Testing
- Unit: encrypt → store → fetch → decrypt round trip
- Integration: full flow with test API key
- CF Worker: wrangler dev for local testing
- Docker: `./bootstrap.sh` then `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`

## Notes
- Python 3.12+ for all Python components
- Node 20+ for wrangler/CF Worker
- wrangler v4+ pinned in bootstrap Dockerfile and worker/package.json
- All Python deps pinned in requirements.txt
- No real keys in git ever — .gitignore covers this
